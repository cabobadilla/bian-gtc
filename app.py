    "Personal Loan Application": """
Personal Loan Application Process:

1. Customer logs into the bank's mobile app using their credentials and navigates to the loan products section.
2. System displays various loan options including personal loans, mortgages, and auto loans.
3. Customer selects a personal loan product and enters their desired loan amount ($10,000) and preferred term (36 months).
4. System pre-fills the application form with the customer's existing information from their profile (name, address, contact details, ID number).
5. Customer provides additional required information:
   - Monthly income: $5,000
   - Employment details: Company name, position, years employed
   - Purpose of loan: Home renovation
   - Existing financial obligations: Other loans, credit cards
6. System performs real-time credit check by calling the credit bureau service and calculates affordability based on income vs. expenses ratio.
7. Based on the customer's credit score (720) and affordability assessment, the system generates a loan offer with:
   - Interest rate: 8.5% APR
   - Monthly payment: $315
   - Term: 36 months
   - Total repayment amount: $11,340
8. Customer reviews all terms and conditions and accepts the offer by clicking "Accept".
9. System generates a digital loan agreement that requires customer's electronic signature.
10. Customer digitally signs the agreement using a one-time password sent to their registered mobile number.
11. Loan servicing system processes the application and initiates the disbursement workflow.
12. Funds are disbursed to the customer's designated checking account within 24 hours.
13. Loan account is created in the core banking system with repayment schedule.
14. Customer receives confirmation notification with loan details and first payment date.
15. Repayment schedule is established with automatic monthly debits from customer's checking account.

    "Credit Card Dispute": """
Credit Card Dispute Handling Process:

1. Customer logs into their mobile banking app and reviews their credit card statement.
2. Customer identifies an unauthorized transaction for $250 at an online merchant they don't recognize.
3. Customer navigates to the "Dispute Transaction" feature in the app and selects the specific transaction.
4. Customer provides reason for dispute: "I did not authorize this transaction" and provides additional details: "I have never shopped at this merchant."
5. System validates the dispute eligibility based on:
   - Transaction date (within 60 days)
   - Transaction type (eligible for dispute)
   - Customer's dispute history (no previous suspicious patterns)
6. System creates a dispute case in the Card Dispute Management System with a unique reference number (DIS-2023-45678).
7. Fraud Detection System analyzes the transaction using AI algorithms to check for:
   - Transaction pattern anomalies
   - Geographical irregularities
   - Merchant risk profile
8. Based on initial fraud assessment, a provisional credit of $250 is applied to the customer's account within 24 hours.
9. Customer receives notification confirming the dispute has been registered and provisional credit applied.
10. Bank's dispute resolution team initiates investigation by:
    - Contacting the merchant for transaction evidence
    - Requesting additional information from the card network (Visa/Mastercard)
    - Reviewing transaction logs and authorization data
11. Merchant responds with transaction evidence including IP address, shipping address, and purchase details.
12. Bank compares evidence against customer information and determines the transaction was indeed fraudulent.
13. Dispute resolution team makes final decision: "Dispute approved in favor of customer".
14. The provisional credit is made permanent in the customer's account.
15. Customer is notified of the decision via app notification, email, and SMS.
16. Case is documented in the compliance system for regulatory reporting.
17. Fraud pattern is logged in the fraud detection database to improve future fraud prevention.

# Instructions
with st.expander("How to use this app"):
    st.markdown("""
    1. Enter your banking use case in the text area or select one of the examples
    2. Choose whether to enhance your use case for better BIAN mapping (recommended)
    3. Click "Analyze Use Case" to process it
    4. View the analysis results in the different tabs:
        - **Use Case Understanding**: Business objectives, actors, events, and process flow
        - **BIAN Mapping**: Relevant BIAN Service Domains and their functions
        - **API Recommendations**: BIAN Semantic APIs and APIs to expose
        - **OpenAPI Spec**: Sample Swagger/OpenAPI specification
        - **Architecture**: Flow of interactions between Service Domains
        - **Debug**: Troubleshooting information if results are incomplete
    
    **Tip**: Providing detailed use cases with clear steps, actors, and banking processes will result in better BIAN mapping.
    
    **Note**: To use this app in Streamlit Cloud, you need to configure your OpenAI API key in the secrets manager.
