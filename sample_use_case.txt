Mortgage Application Processing

A customer wants to apply for a mortgage loan through the bank's digital channels. The process should involve the following steps:

1. The customer submits a mortgage application through the bank's website or mobile app, providing personal information, employment details, income verification, and property information.

2. The system performs an initial eligibility check based on the customer's credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio.

3. If the initial check is successful, the application is forwarded to a loan officer for review.

4. The loan officer reviews the application, may request additional documents, and performs a detailed risk assessment.

5. Upon approval, the system generates a mortgage offer with terms and conditions.

6. The customer reviews and accepts the offer digitally.

7. The bank initiates the property valuation process with a third-party appraiser.

8. Once the property valuation is confirmed, the system prepares the final loan agreement.

9. The customer signs the agreement electronically.

10. The loan is disbursed to the customer's account or directly to the property seller as per the agreement.

11. The mortgage account is created, and monthly payment schedules are set up.
